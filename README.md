# Cactisamp
A WIP UTAU resampler in Python  
  
# Overview  
This is a resampler based on CREPE and pyWorld.  
The code will be updated as soon as a major progress is made.  
(Update Dec 5) I'm considering to cancel this project as it is stupidly slow and has severe performance issues. I have a working prototype but the result isn't pleasing either, so nope.
